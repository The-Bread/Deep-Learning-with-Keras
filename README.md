# **Keras**


**Keras** is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/cntk) or [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. 

We use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

  - Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
  - Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
  - Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.
  
Official documentation of Keras can be found at [Keras.io.](https://keras.io/)

Keras is compatible with: Python 2.7-3.6.
